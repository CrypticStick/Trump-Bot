# Trump-Bot
 
> Note: This was my very first Discord bot; it is now quite outdated
 
My fantasic Discord bot code (Made with Visual Studio - C#). 
You can add it to your server by clicking [**here**](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=321097604131717120&scope=bot&permissions=2146958591 "Add Trump-Bot to your guild!")

You can check out how some of it works, and even copy some parts if you want.
I've purely created this for entertainment; it's something to work on when I'm bored.
However, it's written using the [**Discord.Net API wrapper**](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net "Discord.Net Github Page"), so if you aren't creating a Discord Bot in C#, you probably don't want this.

This bot includes a GUI that can do the following:
* List connected guilds and channels
* Send messages into channels remotely 
* View the bot's console log
* List connected users and toggle between username/nickname
* View server roles and transfer roles to/from users
* Show bot's name and bot's current status

This bot also includes this list of commands:
* **$help** - Lists information about available commands [{CommandName}]
* **$say** - Repeats the given text.
* **$connect4** - Play your favorite game, CONNECT 4! [create, join, info, refresh, end, {1-7}]
* **$profile** - Provides a bunch of cool info about you (definitely not copying Bythos...)
* **$lenny** - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) M'lad
* **$trump** - Trump does some neat stuff. [image,respond (enable,disable) (guild)]
* **$test** - A test command just for me :)
* **$random** - Provides a random number between 1 and 100
* **$undelete** - Recovers previously deleted messages from the current channel (MODS ONLY)  [{UserID} (auto), all, (allGuild)]
* **$clear** - Clears the defined messages (MODS ONLY) [all, user ({UserID}), bot, undelete]  [{# of messages 1-99}]
* **$mute** - Restricts the specified user from speaking (MODS ONLY) [{UserID}]
* **$unmute** - Allows the muted user to speak again (MODS ONLY) [{UserID}]
* **$b** - :b:oi :b:e :b:lessed with the auto :b: converter (MODS ONLY)

This bot isn't even close to done, but it's pretty neat anyways :)
